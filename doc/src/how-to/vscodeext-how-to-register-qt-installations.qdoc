    \title Register Qt installations

    To develop with Qt, you need at least one Qt version. You can install Qt in
    many ways:

    \list
        \li \l{Get and Install Qt with Qt Online Installer}{Use \QOI}
        \li Use a package manager
        \li \l{Building Qt Sources}{Build Qt from sources}
    \endlist

    \section1 Automatic registration

    \QVSC checks whether you have a Qt installation folder at the default path
    and offers to save it in \l{Qt settings}. Select \uicontrol Use to save it
    and to register the Qt versions in it.

    Also, if you install Qt from \c vcpkg, \QVSC detects it and offers to
    create a CMake kit for it. It then uses tools, such as \QD, and paths
    from \c vcpkg. Set the \c {QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH} and
    \c {QML_IMPORT_PATH} environment variables in the \e launch.json file to
    configure the Qt installation.

    If you did not install Qt at the default path, or the \c vcpkg installation
    is not detected automatically, register your Qt versions as described in the
    following sections.

    \section1 \QOI installations

    To register a Qt that you installed with \QOI to a folder that is not on the
    default path:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \uicontrol {Command Palette}, and select
            \uicontrol {Qt: Register Qt Installation}.
        \li Select the folder where you installed Qt, and then select
            \uicontrol {Select the Qt installation path}.
    \endlist

    The command creates CMake kits for each installed Qt version.

    \image vscodeext-kits.webp {CMake kits for installed Qt versions}

    \section1 Other installations

    To register a Qt that you installed from a package manager or that you built
    from sources:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \uicontrol {Command Palette}, and select
            \uicontrol {Qt: Register Qt (qtpaths or qmake)}.
        \li Select the \c qmake or \c qtpaths executable,
            and then select \uicontrol {Select}.
    \endlist

    The command creates a CMake kit for qtpaths.

    \section1 Scan for Qt kits

    If some Qt CMake kits are missing, go to \uicontrol {Command Palette} and
    select \uicontrol {Qt: Scan for Qt Kits}.
